        <h1>Terms describing the inflorescence</h1>
        <p><em>Inflorescence</em> refers to the flowering body of a plant. These occur in an amazing variety of forms, from solitary flowers to enormously complex clusters, 
            and there is an equally amazing variety of technical terminology used to describe them. Unfortunately, as with some other aspects of botany, this 
            terminology is not universally standardized; different authors use different terms for the same structure, and sometimes the same terms in slightly 
            or significantly different ways, and classify structures using different paradigms. We only brush the surface here, making use of a few of the most commonly used terms. </p>

        <p>A basic and useful but somewhat non-immediately-obvious technical distinction is between <em>determinate</em> and <em>indeterminate</em> inflorescences. A determinate 
            form has a fixed endpoint, usually a terminal flower that generally opens first. Lower side branches bear buds that open later. Indeterminate 
            forms are often termed cymose or cymes. An indeterminate form is a shoot that can, at least theoretically, continue growing from the tip and 
            producing more flowers indefinitely. The lower flowers open first, while upper buds may still be tiny and developing. Of course the whole process 
            eventually comes to an end, but the distinction is frequently obvious. Indeterminate forms are termed racemose or racemes, though the latter term 
            also has the more specific technical meaning described below. Of course in botany, nothing is ever simple. There are compound inflorescences that 
            are mixtures of forms in every conceivable combination. </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Solitary: flowers (or heads) borne singly on isolated stems or arising individually from leaf axils. Not part of a larger group.</li>
            <li>Raceme: a simple, indeterminate inflorescence consisting of stalked flowers attached to a central stem and forming a more or less elongated cluster. 
                The stalk of a flower is termed a pedicle and pedicled flowers are implied by the term raceme when used alone in the specific sense. </li>
            <li>Spike: an indeterminate inflorescence consisting of stalkless flowers attached to a central stem, generally forming a highly elongated cluster. 
                A raceme of stalkless flowers. </li>
            <li>Corymb: an indeterminate inflorescence forming a convex or flat-topped cluster, essentially a contracted raceme. Typically flowers arise from a 
                central axis on stalks (pedicles) of different lengths that bring them all to near the same height. The term is also applied to racemes of similar 
                shape with branching pedicles. The outermost flowers generally open first. </li>
            <li>Head: show all
                A compact inflorescence, with the flowers so tightly packed as to appear a single unit. The composite flowers of the sunflower family (asteraceae) 
                are the most familiar examples, but there are many other instances. The term is applied to both determinate and indeterminate units. </li>
            <li>Panicle: show all
                An indeterminate inflorescence consisting of a compound raceme; that is, a central axis bearing racemes as secondary units, or a more general 
                branching structure composed of racemes. The term is sometimes applied to any sort of a loose, branching cluster. </li>
            <li>Cyme: show all
                A determinate inflorescence, often one forming a convex or flat-topped cluster, though the term is applied to other determinate arrangements 
                as well. In all forms, a terminal flower opens first, followed by flowers on lower branches. Multiple levels of branching are frequently involved. </li>
